# HTTP-based-Webproxy
A proxy sits between the HTTP client and HTTP server. When the HTTP client requests resource from HTTP server, it sends the request to the Proxy, the Proxy then forwards the request to the HTTP server, and then the Proxy receives reply from the HTTP server, and finally the Proxy sends this reply to the HTTP client.
